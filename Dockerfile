# There are 2 different method how docker run our program
# Shell form: `CMD command param1 param2` equivalent with 
#             `/bin/sh -c command param1 param2`
# Exec form: `CMD ["command", "param1", "param2"]`
#
# Since shell form running our program inside sh, so the PID 1
# is sh, not our program. Hence, our program never receive stop signal
# So we will use exec form.

# Entrypoint is how docker will execute our program by default
# CMD is the default param and can be replaced by docker params, even though
# we can use it to execute our program.

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
